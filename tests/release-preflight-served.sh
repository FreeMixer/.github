# release-preflight refuses a release of a version the channel already serves, naming the file: the step is read out
# of the action file and run against a stub curl that answers the repository and its tree. Arms: a new version passes;
# the same rpm version, the same deb version (with and without a revision) and a glob name are refused with the file
# named; another package at that version passes; republish lets it through; a dry run and a branch run never ask;
# a deb release passes over the rpms of its own version (its rpm job published them) and refuses its own debs, and the
# same the other way round. Per release: an rpm release for fc45 passes over the same version served for fc44 only and
# is refused once fc45 holds it, a release for fc44 and fc45 is refused by the fc44 file, a deb release for bookworm
# passes over the trixie deb and one for trixie is refused; and with the per-release filter taken out of
# already-served.sh, the fc45 arm goes red.
