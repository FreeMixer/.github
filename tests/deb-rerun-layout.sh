# A rerun of a DEB release after its publish job succeeded. The first attempt uploads the published copies as one
# more artifact of the run, laid out flat, and artifacts outlive their attempt: the download of the next attempt
# must not take them for build output, because publish-tree.sh refuses a package outside <suite>/. Runs the
# workflow's own patterns and steps twice over one tree, against a stand-in for the artifact store. The second arm
# widens the pattern to the one that took the copies in, and the refusal must come back.
