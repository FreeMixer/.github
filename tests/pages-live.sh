# wait.sh of the pages-live action against a stub of the deployments REST API: a curl that answers from files and
# records the POSTs to the Pages builds endpoint. Arms: the commit's deployment is a success (green, no build
# asked); a later deployment that is ahead of the commit is a success (green); a deployment that is behind it is
# not; a deployment still in progress at the timeout (red, naming the deployment and its state); no deployment at
# all (red, and Pages is asked for a build); a failed deployment is followed by a new build that succeeds (green);
# a lagging deployment that turns success in time (green); no token (warned, still waits).
