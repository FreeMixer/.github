## What you can install

Each row is a piece you can use without the rest, with a badge that links to its latest release. Add the repository ([Install](#install))
and install by name; a dash means the piece does not ship in that form.

## REAC

[FreeREAC](https://github.com/FreeREAC) is the free implementation of the Roland REAC audio network that openmixer
uses for stageboxes. Besides libreac, reac-pw and reac-stageboxes above:

- [reac-protocol](https://github.com/FreeREAC/reac-protocol): the protocol reference: wire format, how to capture it, what each block means.
- [reac-tools](https://github.com/FreeREAC/reac-tools): traffic analysis and diagnostics: loss and jitter analyser, simulator, pcap parser, Wireshark dissector.
- [reac-analysis](https://github.com/FreeREAC/reac-analysis): signal analysis of captured audio: clock wobble, spectrum, per-channel decode health.
- [reac-captures](https://github.com/FreeREAC/reac-captures): the capture corpus the protocol is checked against (CC0).
- [reac-transport](https://github.com/FreeREAC/reac-transport) and [reac-repacer](https://github.com/FreeREAC/reac-repacer): REAC over OpenWrt routers and Wi-Fi: a VLAN and tunnel transport, and a relay that evens out a bursty link.
- [reac-docs](https://github.com/FreeREAC/reac-docs): the REAC-over-Wi-Fi findings and the two-router recipe.

## On a Zynthian

The FreeMixer forks of [zynthian-ui](https://github.com/FreeMixer/zynthian-ui) and
[zynthian-sys](https://github.com/FreeMixer/zynthian-sys) (branch `vangelis`) add an engine that runs a Zynthian
chain's LV2 and CLAP plugins through plugin-hostd, with the plugin menus ordered from the measurements
[plugin-qualify](https://github.com/FreeMixer/plugin-qualify) records. Those records, one set per machine class (a
ZynthianOS Vangelis image on a Raspberry Pi 5, Fedora 44 on x86-64), are plugin-db's qualification layer, in
[plugin-db-qualification](https://github.com/FreeMixer/plugin-db-qualification).

## Install

Installing `openmixer-release` adds the repository and its key; `dnf update` and `apt upgrade` keep them current.

Fedora: `sudo dnf install https://www.openmixer.org/rpm/openmixer-release.noarch.rpm`

Debian and Raspberry Pi OS (bookworm, trixie): `curl -fsSLO https://www.openmixer.org/deb/openmixer-release.deb && sudo apt install ./openmixer-release.deb && sudo apt update`

## Checked

[Theorem's OSS Verify](https://github.com/theorem-labs/oss-verify) lists these projects of ours in its `projects/`:
[libdiginet](https://github.com/FreeMixer/libdiginet), [mod-host](https://github.com/FreeMixer/mod-host),
[omx-clap-core](https://github.com/FreeMixer/omx-clap-core), [omx-dsp](https://github.com/FreeMixer/omx-dsp), [plugin-hostd](https://github.com/FreeMixer/plugin-hostd),
[libreac](https://github.com/FreeREAC/libreac), [reac-pw](https://github.com/FreeREAC/reac-pw) and [reac-repacer](https://github.com/FreeREAC/reac-repacer).
Each ships fuzz targets written to its contract. Enrollments open: [plugin-hostd-protocol](https://github.com/FreeMixer/plugin-hostd-protocol) ([#159](https://github.com/theorem-labs/oss-verify/pull/159)), [plugin-db](https://github.com/FreeMixer/plugin-db) ([#163](https://github.com/theorem-labs/oss-verify/pull/163)), [libmackie](https://github.com/FreeMixer/libmackie) ([#164](https://github.com/theorem-labs/oss-verify/pull/164)) and [libsurface](https://github.com/FreeMixer/libsurface) ([#165](https://github.com/theorem-labs/oss-verify/pull/165)).
