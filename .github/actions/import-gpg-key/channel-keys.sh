# The public key files a channel serves (rpm/RPM-GPG-KEY-openmixer, deb/openmixer.asc).
#
#   channel-keys.sh check <key file> <fingerprint>...   every fingerprint is a primary the file serves
#   channel-keys.sh serve <key file> <key id>...        the file becomes what it served plus these keys
#   channel-keys.sh pinned <key file> [<key id>...]     every primary the file serves, and every key named, is pinned
#   channel-keys.sh emit <key file>                     the armored keys of the file plus the committed keys, on stdout
#
# THE TRUST ROOT IS NOT THE CHANNEL. pinned-fingerprints.txt (committed beside this script, in the repository the
# action is checked out from) lists the primaries OpenMixer signs with. A served key file holding any other
# primary is refused by every reader (check, pinned), and check and serve refuse a signing key that is not
# pinned: a channel writer who swaps or adds a key to the file cannot make a publish or a release vouch for
# what that key signed. PINNED_FINGERPRINTS names another list (the tests' throwaway keys).
#
# A served key file is a UNION and only grows: a client that imported an earlier key keeps verifying what
# that key signed, and a new signing key is served next to the old one, never in its place. dnf imports
# from the gpgkey URL the key a package or repomd.xml names; apt reads the signed-by copy the user saved,
# so for apt the index is co-signed while the old key is still in users' keyrings (publish-debs). A key
# leaves the file only by a hand commit to the channel, when its retirement is decided.
#
# SIGNING KEYS COMMITTED HERE. served-keys/*.asc (beside this script; SERVED_KEYS_DIR names another directory)
# holds the public half of every key OpenMixer signs with that is not only in the channel: each is served by
# every publish next to what the channel served (serve), is trusted by the publishers' keystore and keyring and
# shipped by openmixer-release (emit), and is accepted by check before the channel has ever served it, so the
# first release signed by a new key is not refused for a key file that does not hold it yet. Each must be
# pinned; the old key's public half is not here, it stays in the file the channel serves.
#
# check with no file (the first publish into an empty channel) warns and passes: there is nothing yet a
# client could have imported.
