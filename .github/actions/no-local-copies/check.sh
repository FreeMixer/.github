#
# A FreeMixer repository runs the shared checks from FreeMixer/.github and keeps no copy of them: no commit message
# checker, no pattern list, no private-refs engine, no SPDX check, no allow list (the engine reads none, and one left
# lying in a tree is refused), and a commit-msg hook that is the shared stub byte for byte: a missing hook is as red as
# a different one. A copy is found by its name and by its content, so a renamed copy is red too. A release workflow
# is judged here as well (release-order.py): no DEB job runs after a failed RPM job.
