# mod-host-protocol is the FreeMixer fork of mod-host at its commit in .github/pins.txt, built by the fork's own
# debian/ (mod-host, libmod-host-protocol0, libmod-host-protocol-dev), the source the RPMs come from too; the
# installed library is checked by actions/mod-host-protocol/checks/framing-test.sh. The others are fetched at their
# commit in .github/pins.txt and given the debian/ directory of their name here. Each is built binary-only, linted
# and installed, so the next one and the packages that Build-Depend on it find it. Runs as root in a Debian
# container with dpkg-dev, debhelper, build-essential, git and lintian.
