# A public FreeMixer repository holds its code, its data and the documents a user or a developer reads: a guide, a
# specification or reference, a developer document. The record of how work went (a dated note, a run's raw evidence, a
# folder of notes) belongs in the project's records, not in a public tree. Three rules, read from every tracked path:
#
#   - no folder named evidence or notes, at any depth;
#   - no folder whose name carries a date (YYYY-MM-DD or YYYYMMDD): a dated folder is one run's record;
#   - no document (markdown, plain text, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc) whose name carries a date: a dated document is a note.
#
# A data file named by its date or by a run id (a benchmark run, a catalogue run, a fixture, a key) is data and passes;
# a date inside a file's content is never read. No path is exempted: there is no list.
