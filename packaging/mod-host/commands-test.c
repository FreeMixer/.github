/*
 * How many commands an installed libmod-host-protocol takes (the carried protocol-max-commands patch).
 *
 * A host that registers more commands than the table holds lost the last ones in silence: omx-clap-host's 65th was
 * quit. The library now holds 128 and refuses one past them with -1. This registers 65 and checks each is taken,
 * which a library that holds 64 fails (and one whose protocol_add_command returns nothing does not build against).
 * Built against the installed headers and library: framing-test.sh.
