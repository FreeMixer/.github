# The package that adds the OpenMixer repository to dnf, as rpmfusion-free-release does for RPM Fusion: a change
# of baseurl or key reaches every machine as an update of this package. Source1 is the key file the channel
# serves at rpm/RPM-GPG-KEY-openmixer, fetched at build time (build.sh); it is not kept in this repository.
# Version-Release is the release of debian/changelog too: build.sh refuses a build where the two differ.
